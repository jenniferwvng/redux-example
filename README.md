Dev Ed on Youtube from 2019, be aware this is before Redux Toolkit became standard
For instructions on how to install Toolkit (RTK) - https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts - watched for general understanding but used RTK instead.

Guide for this RTK code:

Beware there's a mistake (if I didn't miss out on something?) in the documentation, what you want to import is counterSlice and not counterReducer in app/store.js

Redux or Redux Toolkit?
